## Overview:
This is a simple browser-based password generator that builds a string of random characters. The page gives prompts on loading that allow the user to choose the length of their password and the type of characters (uppercase, lowercase, numerals, and special symbols) that it will include. The page then returns the random password in a string that can be copied and pasted.
        
## Installation:
Installation is as simple as cloning the repo locally. This app uses static files, so it is very compact and the directory can be located anywhere.
        
## Usage:
After cloning the repository locally, open index.html in your browser. Click the "generate password" button and the page will begin displaying prompts that allow you to input characteristics of your password. Once the password is generated, you can copy and paste it wherever you need it.
