Homework 3: Javascript password generator

So far this project has taught me a couple of useful functions within javascript (parseInt and isNaN) and more generally about how to define and execute functions. Having a functioning example to work backward from has made this a much better learning experience because it has let me focus on just understanding how the code works instead of whether I'm doing it right.
