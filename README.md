Homework 3: Javascript password generator

So far this project has taught me a couple of useful functions within javascript (parseInt and isNaN) and more generally about how to define and execute functions. Having a functioning example to work backward from has made this a much better learning experience because it has let me focus on just understanding how the code works instead of whether I'm doing it right.

It's very interesting to see how much can ultimately be done with a few lines of code. It seems like a big part of mastering javascript will be learning about all the functionality built into it and how to call those functions.

I annotated the code line by line with comments and find this to be a very helpful way to make sure I understand it myself.
